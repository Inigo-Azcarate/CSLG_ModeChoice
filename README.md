**Mobility mode choice model using Gipuzkoa (Spain) as a use case**

# Folders
- [input_data](https://github.com/Inigo-Azcarate/CSLG_ModeChoice/tree/main/input_data) contains all the data necessary to run the AI model in the \model folder. Most data is generated after running the code in the \preprocessing folder. If you are having any kind of problem, you can download the file with all the data to run the model on this link: 
- [model](https://github.com/Inigo-Azcarate/CSLG_ModeChoice/tree/main/model) contains the code to create the supervised learning AI model that predicts the mobility choices. 
- [preprocessing](https://github.com/Inigo-Azcarate/CSLG_ModeChoice/tree/main/preprocessing) contains the codes to generate the files in \input_data. To run the code, you will have to download the raw data folder from this link and paste it inside /preprocessing.

Inside each folder, you have a brief explanation of how code flow.
