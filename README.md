**Mobility mode choice model using Gipuzkoa (Spain) as a use case**

# Folders
- [input_data](https://github.com/Inigo-Azcarate/CSLG_ModeChoice/tree/main/input_data) contains all the data necessary to run the AI model in the [model](https://github.com/Inigo-Azcarate/CSLG_ModeChoice/tree/main/model) folder. Most the data is generated after running the code in the [preprocessing](https://github.com/Inigo-Azcarate/CSLG_ModeChoice/tree/main/preprocessing) folder. If you are having any kind of problem, you can download the file with all the data to run the model on this link: 
- [model](https://github.com/Inigo-Azcarate/CSLG_ModeChoice/tree/main/model) contains the code to create the supervised learning AI model that predicts the mobility choices. 
- [preprocessing](https://github.com/Inigo-Azcarate/CSLG_ModeChoice/tree/main/preprocessing) contains the codes and the raw data to create the files in input files in \input_data.


# Code files
- `surveys.ipynb` cleans, treats and postprocessesof the survey data, adding salary data to each trip-taker
- `analysis_graphics.ipynb` generates graphs related to mode of transportation from survey data
- `population_generation.ipynb` generates a placeholder of ~2500 workers commuting to Eskuzaitzeta.
- `landuse&section_aggregation.ipynb` generates a building database, including land use and neighborhood-wealth characteristics
- `intermunicipal_travel_cost.ipynb` calculates travel fares between towns and regions for different public transport companies
- `create_road_network.ipynb` creates the pandana road network from OpenStreetMaps to calculate driving times from origin to destination
- `GTFS_transit_24.ipynb` creates the pandana transit networks (24, one for each hour) to calculate bus times from origin to destination
- `GTFS_train_24.ipynb` creates the pandana train networks (24, one for each hour) to calculate bus times from origin to destination

- `model.ipynb` adds noise to survey data, assigns origin and destination to each trip, and calculates the mode of transportationâ€™s travel time and travel cost. Then, it trains the supervised learning AI model.
- `predict.ipynb` uses the aforementioned AI model (Random Forest Classifier) and predicts the mode of transportation for an specific population
