- `pre_model.ipynb` adds noise to survey data, assigns origin and destination to each trip, and calculates the travel time for each mode of transportation.
- `training_model.ipynb` reads the output file from `pre_model.ipynb` and trains the supervised learning AI model.
- `predict_().ipynb` are different codes predicting the mobility mode choice in a number scenarios using the aforementioned AI model. This scenarios include:
    - Moving people closer to their workplace.
    - Moving people to a walkable distance from their workplace.
    - Changing the workplace location.
    - ...
